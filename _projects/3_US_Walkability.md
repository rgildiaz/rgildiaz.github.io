# Walkability in the US

_Analyzing the National Walkability Index Database_

_2023.04.28_

It's no secret that the United States suffers from a "car culture". Parking lots bigger than the malls or apartments they were built for are a regular sight in metropolitan areas. The US highway network spans [over 4 million miles](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183397/united-states-highway-mileage-since-1990/), and an estimated [3.17 _trillion_ vehicle-miles were driven in 2022](https://www.statista.com/statistics/185579/us-vehicle-miles-in-transit-since-1960/) alone.

When put compared with other major countries around the world, it becomes apparent just how much more Americans drive: in 2017, 4.1 million passenger-miles (distance of trip Ã— number of passengers) were traveled in the US, less than Japan, Great Britain, and Australia combined ([source](https://data.oecd.org/transport/passenger-transport.htm)).
